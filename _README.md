# Data Analytics Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository highlights my ability to analyze, visualize, and communicate data-driven insights using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. 
Each project is inspired by practical, real-world challenges and showcases my ability to convert complex datasets into clear, impactful insights.

My projects are also numbered and stated in README notes per folder for better understanding of the datasets used.
