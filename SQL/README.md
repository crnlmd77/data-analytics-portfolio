# 🗄️ SQL Portfolio – Data Analytics Projects

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of data analytics projects powered by SQL. The datasets used are from Kaggle and Mode.com. Each project demonstrates my ability to extract, transform, and analyze data using structured queries to uncover insights and solve real-world business problems.

### Project 1: Airline Flights Dataset
- This project uses the [Airlines Flights Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
- This project correlates with Airlines_Flights_Data.ipynb in my Python and Airlines_Flights_Data.pbix  in my Power BI repository folder.
- This script analyzes sales trends, identifies top-performing airlines, and segments based on booking behavior.
