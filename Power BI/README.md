Welcome to my Personal Portfolio for Power BI! This includes the projects that I've worked using public datasets on to improve my knowledge in Data Analytics in terms of converting data into powerful visualizations to help drive goal-driven and holistic solutions.

## Project 1: Airline Performance Dashboard
- This project uses the [Airlines Flights Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data) from Kaggle.
### 📁 File
- This project correlates with Dynamic_Airfare_Insights.ipynb in my Python and airlines_flights_data.sql in my SQL repository folder. 

  
### This Power BI dashboard analyzes flight data across airlines, cities, and travel classes. Key insights include:
- Total Sales per Airline
- Class comparison: Economy vs Business
- Route popularity heatmap
- Price trends vs Days left
